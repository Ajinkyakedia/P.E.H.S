                E-learning" refers to the use of electronic technologies, primarily the internet, to facilitate learning and education. This form of learning allows individuals to access educational materials and resources through digital platforms, often outside of traditional classroom settings. E-learning can take various forms, including online courses, virtual classrooms, webinars, interactive multimedia content, and more.
            
                Key features of e-learning include:
                
                Flexibility: E-learning provides flexibility in terms of time and location. Learners can access course materials and participate in activities at their own pace and from anywhere with an internet connection.
                
                Accessibility: E-learning breaks down geographical barriers, allowing individuals from different locations to access the same educational content. This is particularly beneficial for learners in remote or underserved areas.
                
                Multimedia: E-learning often incorporates multimedia elements, such as videos, interactive simulations, and quizzes, to enhance the learning experience. This multimedia approach can cater to different learning styles and make the content more engaging.
                
                Interactivity: Many e-learning platforms offer interactive features, enabling learners to actively participate in the learning process. This may include discussions, group activities, and real-time feedback.
